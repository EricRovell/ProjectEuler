In order to search the number of divisors of the given integer effectively
we need to use prime factorization.

! Suppose, we already have a list of primes (we can use Eratothenes sieve).

Any composite number can be decomposed into a product of smaller integers.
If these integers are further restricted to primes numbers, the process is called
'prime factorization':

number = product of primes to some power
number = prime1^a1 * prime2^a2 ...

Let's have an example: number = 36

This can be put into prime factors as:
  36 = 2^2 * 3^2.

Now, the factor:
  2 can be chosen in 3 ways: 0 (none), 1 or 2 times.
  3 can be chosen in 3 ways: 0 (none), 2 or 3 times.
(If neither is chosen, we get the factor 2^0 * 3^0 = 1)

All together, there will be 3 * 3 = 9 factors of 36. These are:
  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36

The general rule for the number of factors is to increase the powers 
of the factors by 1 and multiply these together.

So:
  a^n * b^m * c^p  will have (n + 1)(m + 1)(p + 1) factors.


P.S
And at last, to make the search faster, we can look for a number of divisors
not in the triangle number itself, but in it's 'parts'.
Any triangle number can be expressed as:

  T(n) = n * (n + 1) / 2,
    Multiple 1:    n    or   (n/2)
    Multiple 2: (n + 1) or (n + 1)/2

n and (n + 1) -> coprimes,
thus the total number of divisors could be found:

if 'n' is even:
  D(T(n)) = D(n/2) * D(n + 1)

if 'n' is odd:
  D(T(n)) = D(n) * D((n + 1)/2)

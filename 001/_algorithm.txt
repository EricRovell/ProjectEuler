In order to solve this problem for any number of divisors:

We can use iterable (set, list, or array) 
filled with any number of divisors and unpack them as function arguments.

1. Initialize a variable for storing sum value with initial value equals zero.
2. Using loop iterate over all natural numbers.
3. Create 2nd loop inside and iterate over divisors.
4. Check if :
                 number mod(divisor) = 0
5. If this condition works for any divisor:
  - add the number's value to sum
  - break out of the loop, there is no need to check further.
6. After both loops terminated -> return sum value.

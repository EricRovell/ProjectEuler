1. Determine the digits in the passcode by making a list
  of digits in the keys, without duplicates.

2. Make a list of pairs of numbers from the order in the keys.
  (1, 2, 3) -> (1, 2), (2, 3)

3. Find the unique digit which never appears
  at the beginning of any of the pairs.
  ! This is the last digit in the passcode,
  because nothing comes after it.

4. Remove pairs which include the last digit in the second entry 
  of the pair, and repeat step 3 to find the second-last digit and so on.

5. Loop this process N times, where N is the length of the passcode
  until you have constructed the whole passcode.
